# Dice Roll Calculator
A Progressive Web App (PWA) about dice and some basic arithmetics ;P

## Functionality
If you know tabletop role-playing games like "Dungeons & Dragons", you might be familiar with calculations that include dice rolls.
With tihs project I want to equip all the role-players out there with some lightweight dice rolling tool.

You can enter the formula for your roll end let the tool take over all the maths.

### Examples
- d6
- d12
- d100
- 2d6
- 4d20 + 5

## Technologies, Frameworks & Libraries
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [KoliBri](https://public-ui.github.io/) (for accessibility)
